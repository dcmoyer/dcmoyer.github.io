<h3>The Overnight Test</h3>
<p>
<i>Linds Redding</i><br>

</p>

<p>
Many years ago, when I first started to work in the advertising industry, we<br>
used to have this thing called The Overnight Test. It worked like this: My<br>
creative partner Laurence and I would spend the day covering A2 sheets torn<br>
from layout pads with ideas for whatever project we were currently engaged<br>
upon â€“ an ad for a new gas oven, tennis racket or whatever. Scribbled<br>
headlines. Bad puns. Stick-men drawings crudely rendered in fat black Magic<br>
Marker. It was a kind of brain dump I suppose. Everything that tumbled out of<br>
our heads and mouths was committed to paper. Anything completely ridiculous,<br>
irrelevant or otherwise unworkable was filtered out as we worked, and by beer<br>
'o' clock there would be an impressive avalanche of screwed-up paper filling<br>
the corner of the room where our comically undersized waste-bin resided.<br>
<br>

On a productive day, aside from the mountain of dead trees (recycling hadn't<br>
been invented in 1982), stacked polystyrene coffee cups and an overflowing as<br>
-tray, there would also be a satisfying thick sheaf of "concepts." Some<br>
almost fully formed and self-contained ideas. Others misshapen and graceless<br>
fragments, but harbouring perhaps the glimmer of a smile or a grain of human<br>
truth which had won it's temporary reprieve from the reject pile. Before<br>
trotting off to Clarks Bar to blow the froth of a pint of Eighty-Bob, our<br>
last task was to pin everything up on the walls of our office.<br>
<br>

Hangovers not withstanding, the next morning at the crack of ten 'o' clock<br>
we'd reconvene in our work-room and sit quietly surveying the fruits of our<br>
labour. Usually about a third of the 'ideas' came down straight away, before<br>
anyone else wandered past. It's remarkable how something that seems either<br>
arse-breakingly funny, or cosmically profound in the white heat of it's<br>
inception, can mean absolutely nothing in the cold light of morning. By mid<br>
morning coffee, the creative department was coming back to life, and we<br>
participated in the daily ritual of wandering around the airy Georgian<br>
splendour of our Edinburgh offices and critiquing each teams crumpled<br>
creations. It wasn't brutal or destructive. Creative people are on the whole<br>
fragile beings, and letting each other down gently and quietly was the<br>
unwritten rule. Sometimes just a blank look or a scratched head was enough to<br>
see a candidate quietly pulled down and consigned to the bin. Something<br>
considered particularly "strong," witty or clever would elicit cries of "Hey,<br>
come and see what the boys have come up with!"  Our compadres would pile into<br>
our cramped room to offer praise or constructive criticism. That was always a<br>
good feeling.<br>
<br>

This human powered bullshit filter was a handy and powerful tool. Inexpensive,<br>
and practically foolproof. Not much slipped through the net. I'm quite sure<br>
architects, musicians, mathematicians and cake decorators all have an<br>
equivalent time-honed protocol.<br>
<br>

But here's the thing.<br>
<br>

The Overnight Test only works if you can afford to wait overnight. To sleep<br>
on it. Time moved on, and during the nineties technology overran, and<br>
transformed the creative industry like it did most others. Exciting new tool<br>
. Endless new possibilities. Pressing new deadlines. With the new digital<br>
tools at our disposal we could romp over the creative landscape at full tilt.<br>
Have an idea, execute it and deliver it in a matter of a few short hours. Or<br>
at least a long night. At first it was a great luxury. We could cover so much<br>
more ground. Explore all the angles. And having exhausted all the available<br>
possibilities, craft a solution we could have complete faith in.<br>
<br>

Or as the bean counters upstairs quickly realized, we could just do three<br>
times as many jobs in the same amount of time, and make them three times as<br>
much money. For the same reason that Jumbo Jets don't have the grand pianos<br>
and palm-court cocktail bars we were originally promised in the brochures,<br>
the accountants naturally won the day.<br>
<br>

Pretty soon, The Overnight Test became the Over Lunch Test. Then before we<br>
knew it, we were eating Pot-Noodles at our desks, and taking it in turns to<br>
go home and see our kids before they went to bed. As fast as we could pin an<br>
idea on the wall, some red-faced account manager in a bad suit would run away<br>
with it. Where we used to rely on taking a break and "stretching the eyes' to<br>
allow us to see the wood from the trees (too many idioms and similes? Probably.)<br>
We now fell back on experience and gut-feel. It worked most of the time,<br>
but nobody is infallible. Some howlers and growlers definitely made it<br>
through, and generally standards plummeted.<br>
<br>

The other consequence, with the benefit of hindsight, is that we became more<br>
conservative. Less likely to take creative risks and rely on the tried and<br>
trusted. The familiar is always going to research better than the truly<br>
novel. An research was the new god. The trick to being truly creative, I've<br>
always maintained, is to be completely unselfconscious. To resist the urge to<br>
self-censor. To not-give-a-shit what anybody thinks. That's why children are<br>
so good at it. And why people with Volkswagens, and mortgages, Personal<br>
Equity Plans and matching Lois Vutton luggage are not.<br>
<br>

It takes a certain amount of courage, thinking out loud. And is best done in<br>
a safe and nurturing environment. Creative Departments and design studios<br>
used to be such places, where you could say and do just about anything<br>
creatively speaking, without fear of ridicule or judgement. It has to be this<br>
way, or you will just close up like a clamshell. It's like trying to have<br>
sex, with your mum listening outside the bedroom door. Can't be done. Then<br>
some bright spark had the idea of setting everyone up in competition. It<br>
became a contest. A race. Winner gets to keep his job.<br>
<br>

Now of course we are all suffering from the same affliction. Our technology<br>
whizzes along at the velocity of a speeding electron, and our poor overtaxed<br>
neurons struggle to keep up. Everything has become a split-second decision.<br>
Find something you like. Share it. Have a half-baked thought. Tweet it. Don't<br>
wait. Don't hesitate. Seize the moment. Keep up. There will be plenty of time<br>
to repent later. Oh, and just to cover your ass, don't forget to stick a<br>
smiley on the end just in case you've overstepped the mark.<br>
<br>

So. To recap, The Overnight Test is a good thing. And sadly missed. A weekend<br>
is even better, and as they fell by the wayside, they were missed too. "If<br>
you don't come in on Saturday, don't bother turning up on Sunday!" as the old<br>
advertising joke goes.<br>
<br>

A week would be nice. A month would be an unreasonable luxury. I've now<br>
'enjoyed' the better part of six months of enforced detachment from my old<br>
reality. When your used to turning on a sixpence, shooting from the hip,<br>
dancing on a pin-head (too many again?), the view back down from six months<br>
is quite giddying. And sobering.<br>
<br>

My old life looks, and feels, very different from the outside.<br>
<br>

And here's the thing.<br>
<br>

It turns out I didn't actually like my old life nearly as much as I thought I<br>
did. I know this now because I occasionally catch up with my old colleagues<br>
and work-mates. They fall over each other to  enthusiastically show me the<br>
latest project they're working on. Ask my opinion. Proudly show off their<br>
technical prowess (which is not inconsiderable.) I find myself glazing over<br>
but politely listen as they brag about who's had the least sleep and the most<br>
takaway food. "I haven't seen my wife since January, I can't feel my legs any<br>
more and I think I have scurvy but another three weeks and we'll be done.<br>
It's got to be done by then The client's going on holiday. What do I think?"<br>
<br>

What do I think?<br>
<br>

I think you're all fucking mad. Deranged. So disengaged from reality it's not<br>
even funny. It's a fucking TV commercial. Nobody give a shit.<br>
<br>

This has come as quite a shock I can tell you. I think, I've come to the<br>
conclusion that the whole thing was a bit of a con. A scam. An elaborate hoax.<br>
<br>

The scam works like this:<br>
<br>

1. The creative industry operates largely by holding 'creative' people ransom<br>
to their own self-image, precarious sense of self-worth, and fragile â€“ if<br>
occasionally out of control ego. We tend to set ourselves impossibly high<br>
standards, and are invariably our own toughest critics. Satisfying our own<br>
lofty demands is usually a lot harder than appeasing any client, who in my<br>
experience tend to have disappointingly low expectations. Most artists and<br>
designers I know would rather work all night than turn in a sub-standard job.<br>
It is a universal truth that all artists think they a frauds and charlatans,<br>
and live in constant fear of being exposed. We believe by working harder than<br>
anyone else we can evaded detection. The bean-counters rumbled this centuries<br>
ago and have been profitably exploiting this weakness ever since. You don't<br>
have to drive creative folk like most workers. They drive themselves. Just<br>
wind 'em up and let 'em go.<br>
<br>

2. Truly creative people tend not to be motivated by money. That's why so few<br>
of us have any. The riches we crave are acknowledgment and appreciation of<br>
the ideas that we have and the things that we make. A simple but sincere<br>
"That's quite good." from someone who's opinion we respect (usually a fellow<br>
artisan) is worth infinitely more than any pay-rise or bonus. Again, our<br>
industry masters cleverly exploit this insecurity and vanity by offering<br>
glamorous but worthless trinkets and elaborately staged award schemes to keep<br>
the artists focused and motivated. Like so many demented magpies we flock<br>
around the shiny things and would peck each others eyes out to have more than<br>
anyone else. Handing out the odd gold statuette is a whole lot cheaper than<br>
dishing out stock certificates or board seats.<br>
<br>

3. The compulsion to create is unstoppable. It's a need that has to be fille<br>
. I've barely 'worked' in any meaningful way for half a year, but every day I<br>
find myself driven to 'make' something. Take photographs. Draw. Write. Make<br>
bad music. It's just an itch than needs to be scratched. Apart from the<br>
occasional severed ear or descent into fecal-eating dementia the creative<br>
impulse is mostly little more than a quaint eccentricity. But introduce this<br>
mostly benign neurosis into a commercial context.. well that way, my friends<br>
lies misery and madness.<br>
<br>

This hybridisation of the arts and business is nothing new of course â€“ it's<br>
been going on for centuries â€“ but they have always been uncomfortable<br>
bed-fellows. But even artists have to eat, and the fuel of commerce and<br>
industry is innovation and novelty. Hey! Let's trade. "Will work for food!"<br>
as the street-beggars sign says.<br>
<br>

This Faustian pact has been the undoing of many great artists, many more<br>
journeymen and more than a few of my good friends. Add to this volatile<br>
mixture the powerful accelerant of emerging digital technology and all hell<br>
breaks loose. What I have witnessed happening in the last twenty years is the<br>
aesthetic equivalent of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. The<br>
wholesale industrialization and mechanistation of the creative process. Our<br>
ad agencies, design groups, film and music studios have gone from being<br>
cottage industries and guilds of craftsmen and women, essentially unchanged<br>
from the middle-ages, to dark sattanic mills of mass production. Ideas<br>
themselves have become just another disposable commodity to be supplied to<br>
order by the lowest bidder. As soon as they figure out a way of outsourcing<br>
thinking to China they won't think twice. Believe me.<br>
<br>

So where does that leave the artists and artisans? Well, up a watercolour of<br>
shit creek without a painbrush. That one thing that we prize and value above<br>
all else â€“ the idea â€“  turns out to be just another plastic gizmo or widget<br>
to be touted and traded. And to add insult to injury we now have to create<br>
them not in our own tine, but according to the quota and the production<br>
schedule. "We need six concepts to show the client first thing in the<br>
morning, he's going on holiday. Don't waste too much time on them though,<br>
it's only meeting-fodder. He's only paying for one so they don't all have to<br>
be good, just knock something up. You know the drill. Oh, and one more thing.<br>
His favourite color is green. Rightho! See you in the morning then... I'm<br>
off to the Groucho Club."<br>
<br>

Have you ever tried to have an idea. Any idea at all, with a gun to your<br>
head? This is the daily reality for the creative drone. And when he's done,<br>
sometime in the wee small hours, he then has to face his two harshest<br>
critics. Himself, and everyone else. "Ah. Sorry. Client couldn't make the<br>
meeting. I faxed your layouts to him at his squash club. He quite liked the<br>
green one. Apart from the typeface, the words, the picture and the idea. Oh,<br>
and could the logo be bigger? Hope it wasn't a late night. Thank god for<br>
computers eh? Rightho! I'm off to lunch."<br>
<br>

Alright, it's not bomb disposal. But in it's own way it's dangerous and<br>
demanding work. And as I've said, the rewards tend to be vanishingly small.<br>
Plastic gold statuette anyone? I've seen quite a few creative drones fall by<br>
the wayside over the years. Booze mostly. Drugs occasionally. Anxiety.<br>
Stress. Broken marriages. Lots of those. Even a couple of suicides. But<br>
mostly just people temperamentally and emotionally ill-equipped for such a<br>
hostile and toxic environment. Curiously, there never seems to be any<br>
shortage of eager young worker drones queuing up to try their luck, although<br>
I detect that even their bright-eyed enthusiasm is staring to wane.<br>
Advertising was the sexy place to be in the eighties. The zeitgeist has move<br>
on. And so have most of the bright-young-things.<br>
<br>

So how did I survive for thirty years? Well it was a close shave. Very close.<br>
And while on the inside I am indeed a 'delicate flower' as some Creative<br>
Director once wryly observed, I have enjoyed until recently, the outward<br>
physical constitution and rude heath of an ox. I mostly hid my insecurity and<br>
fear from everyone but those closest to me, and ran fast enough that I would<br>
never be found out. The other thing I did, I now discover, was to convince<br>
myself that there was nothing else, absolutely nothing, I would rather be<br>
doing. That I had found my true calling in life, and that I was unbelievably<br>
lucky to be getting paid â€“ most of the time â€“ for something that I was<br>
passionate about, and would probably be doing in some form or other anyway.<br>
<br>

It turns out that my training and experience had equipped me perfectly for<br>
this epic act of self-deceit. This was my gig. My schtick. Constructing a<br>
compelling and convincing argument to buy, from the thinnest of evidence was<br>
what we did. "Don't sell the sausage. Sell the sizzle" as we were taught at<br>
ad school.<br>
<br>

Countless late nights and weekends, holidays, birthdays, school recitals and<br>
anniversary dinners were willingly sacrificed at the altar of some intangible<br>
but infinitely worthy higher cause. It would all be worth it in the long run...<br>
<br>

This was the con. Convincing myself that there was nowhere I'd rather be was<br>
just a coping mechanism. I can see that now. It was'nt really important. Or<br>
of any consequence at all really. How could it be. We were just shifting<br>
product. Our product, and the clients. Just meeting the quota. Feeding the<br>
beast as I called it on my more cynical days.<br>
<br>

So was it worth it?<br>
<br>

Well of course not. It turns out it was just advertising. There was no higher<br>
calling. No ultimate prize. Just a lot of faded, yellowing newsprint, and old<br>
video cassettes in an obsolete format I can't even play any more even if I<br>
was interested. Oh yes, and a lot of framed certificates and little gold<br>
statuettes. A shit-load of empty Prozac boxes, wine bottles, a lot of grey<br>
hair and a tumor of indeterminate dimensions.<br>
<br>

It sounds like I'm feeling sorry for myself again. I'm not. It was fun for<br>
quite a lot of the time. I was pretty good at it. I met a lot of funny,<br>
talented and clever people, got to become an overnight expert in everything<br>
from shower-heads to sheep-dip, got to scratch my creative itch on a daily<br>
basis, and earned enough money to raise the family which I love, and even see<br>
them occasionally.<br>
<br>

But what I didn't do, with the benefit of perspective, is anything of any<br>
lasting importance. At least creatively speaking. Economically I probably<br>
helped shift some merchandise. Enhanced a few companies bottom lines. Helped<br>
make one or two wealthy men a bit wealthier than they already were.<br>
<br>

As a life, it all seemed like such a good idea at the time.<br>
<br>

But I'm not really sure it passes The Overnight Test.<br>
<br>

Pity.<br>
<br>

Oh. And if your reading this while sitting in some darkened studio or edit<br>
suite agonizing over whether housewife A should pick up the soap powder with<br>
her left hand or her right, do yourself a favour. Power down. Lock up and go<br>
home and kiss your wife and kids.<br>
