<p class="quotes">
I don't think C gets enough credit. Sure, C doesn't love you. C isn't about
love--C is about thrills. C hangs around in the bad part of town. C knows all
the gang signs. C has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and
never wears a helmet, because that would mess up C's punked-out hair. C likes
to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that you'd like
something, and C will pretend to ignore you; the next day, C will bring you
one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk
that makes your heart race. Where did C get it? "It fell off a truck," C
says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like C doesn't know the
meaning of "private" or "protected": what C wants, C takes. This excites you.
C knows how to get you anything but safety. C will give you anything but
commitment. In the end, you'll leave C, not because you want something
better, but because you can't handle the intensity. C says "I'm gonna live
fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse," but you know that C can
never die, not so long as C is still the fastest thing on the road.<br>

<p class="quotes">
Once, long ago, I took a karate class. My karate instructor was very strict,
but taught us well, and cared passionately for the martial arts. One day, I
learned that he, a married older man, was having an affair.
I was shocked and somewhat upset; how could this teacher who I respected so
much do something which to me was so abhorant. But in that moment I remembered,
I hadn't come to his classes to learn to be a good human, or to understand
any moral truth. I had come to his class to learn karate.
Being a good karate instructor does not make one morally upstanding,
nor does it qualify one to speak about other things; similarly being a morally
upstanding person does not qualify a person to teach karate.
Nevertheless, I did not return to class.

Mathematics is very much like poetry. What makes a good poem -- a great poem -- is that there is a large amount of thought expressed in very few words.
In this sense
\[e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0 ~~~\text{ or }~~~ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}\]
are poems<br>
